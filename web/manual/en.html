<h2> Examples of using cards </h2>

<h3> Examples # 1 </h3>

<img src = "img_manual/8.png" width = "800" height = "440" />
<p> We look like a yellow card number 60, it adds + 3 technologies to everyone (Red-brown group) in total after the turn
    this map, the user and the opponent will add these resources to the area on the screen below </p>
<img src = "img_manual/6.png" width = "800" height = "440" />
<p> We make a move, and the opponent at the same time makes a move with the card of the blue group number 25 </p>
<img src = "img_manual/9.png" width = "800" height = "380" />
<p> As a result, the player and the opponent have got +3 technologies +1 per turn, in total it has become 10. </p>
<img src = "img_manual/9_1.png" width = "780" height = "440" />

<p> At the same time, the opponent spent 3 resources of the blue group and now has only 4. At the same time, the card has decreased the value
    shaft growth every turn, now the arrow points down and has a value of 1, which means the shaft does not grow every turn and
    remains unchanged. The card also increased the value of the attack on the rampart and the enemy fort, displayed behind the fort
    rival and equal to 2. Means that each move the opponent will subtract 2 from the user's shaft, pay attention
    that the user's shaft has become equal to 13. And when the shaft becomes 0 it will already decrease the user's fort. </p>
<img src = "img_manual/10.png" width = "800" height = "400" />
<p> The map was also added to the menu </p>

<h3> Examples # 2 </h3>
<img src = "img_manual/9.png" width = "800" height = "380" />

<img src = "img_manual/11.png" width = "800" height = "380" />
<p> As you can see, all the cards of the green group have been removed from the player. At the same time, the opponent used the card to discard all the cards of the brown group from the opponent (that is, from the player) and additionally threw off the cards of the korchin group. As a result, the mailbox player has a completely renewed deck. </p>

<img src = "img_manual/14.png" width = "800" height = "380" />
<p> Map 33 has been added to the player menu </p>
<img src = "img_manual/13.png" width = "800" height = "380" />
<p> As a result, the player resembled card 33 and the opponent with attack card 128. The player in the area of ​​the shaft began to point up and 1 appeared, which would increase the shaft each turn by 1. In the area of ​​blue resources, the arrow points down and displays 1, which means that units (resources of the blue group) are not added every turn. </p>
<p> The opponent inflicted a level of 6 units to the user's shaft, he already inflicts + 2 damage per turn; in total, the user's shaft became equal to -1, but increased by +1 per turn and became equal to 0. For himself, he increased the shaft by +1. </p>
